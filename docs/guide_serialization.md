As mentioned in previous chapters, the game world and its associated game objects must be packed on the server side, serialized, and broadcast to all clients at regular intervals.  These game world update are called syncs.

Serialization requires that each game object define those attributes which must be serialized on every sync.  This attribute list is known as the game objectâ€™s netscheme.  The larger a netscheme is, the more data will need to be transferred on every sync.  Therefore care should be taken to minimize the amount of data in the netscheme.

The serialization process allows for a hierarchy of objects.  This means that the netscheme of one object may include another object which has its own netscheme.
